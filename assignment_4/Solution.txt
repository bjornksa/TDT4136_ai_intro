------------- CONCLUSION -------------
For the easy board, the backtrack function is called only once and never returns false.
This means that the algorithm finds a solution on the first try without ever making mistakes.

For medium the backtrack function is called three times, but never returns false.
The algorithm guesses values two times, but guesses correctly and doesn't need to backtrack 

Hard requires 12 guesses, wherein 4 didn't lead to a possible solution and needs to be backtracked

Very Hard requires 68 guesses and backtracks in most of them, possibly due to the simple implementation
of select_unassigned_variable instead of using more sophisticated heuristics such as MRV or degree.
